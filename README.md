Hi, I'm Amber. I build software for the interwebs using tools like Javascript and cloud services.

Here's my [website](https://wilkie.tech).
And you'll find me on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/amber/).
I [tweet](https://twitter.com/heyamberwilkie) sometimes. Other times I post photos on the [instas](https://www.instagram.com/heyamberwilkie/). 
Say hi anytime.
